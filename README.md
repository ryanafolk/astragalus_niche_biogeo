## BAMM
Scripts, input, and output for BAMM. `Tree_check.R` is basic input tree and prior checking (output `myPriors.txt`). `config.txt` gives settings for the BAMM run. `bammtools_diversification.R` is postprocessing of BAMM results in BAMMtools. `sample_fractions.txt` is the file that encodes missing taxon proportions. `chromosomes_raw.txt` gives input chromosome data, recoded in file `chromosomes_cleaned.txt` per the Methods section. Otherwise all `.csv` files are input data for trait-associated diversification and all `.svg` and `.pdf` files are figures from the output.
